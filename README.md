# Hangman-Game
This is a Hangman game with an LGBTQAI+ theme.
This Hangman game has a small animation issue where the flag ends up at the wrong side of the screen after your third or second wrong try. It doesn't affect the gameplay at all. It may just look a bit strange from a player's perspective. I feel the strong need to mention that this was my very first "serious" coding project. I'm a complete beginner, a noob, an amateur you name it. But just like with every other skill, practice makes perfect 🫶🏻
