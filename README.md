# Hangman-Game
This is a Hangman game with an LGBTQAI+ theme.
I only know for sure that this works on Windows because it has been tested twice and on two different laptops.
Before you try the Hangman game you need the following things installed

1. VSCode
2. Python
3. the python library 'Pygame' (type 'pip install pygame' directly in the terminal unless already installed)
4. the python library 'TKinter' (type 'pip install tk' directly in the terminal unless already installed)

Once you have these 4 things installed you can move on to the following steps:

Step 1:  Download file. Click on the three dots next to the title "Hangman-Game" and click on "Download". The file will then be downloaded automatically

Step 2: Move the file to your desktop

Step 3: Right-click on file and select "Extract all" or "Extrahera alla" if you are swedish. Click on "Extract/Extrahera" and a yellow folder will pop up on your desktop. Click on that folder and you will see the Hangman python file.

Step 4: You need to move the file directly into VSCode. Once there, you will see all of code. Just ignore that (or go ahead and look at the code I won't stop you) and click on Run and it should work.
