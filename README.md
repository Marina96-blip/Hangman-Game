# Hangman-Game
This is a Hangman game with an LGBTQAI+ theme.
This Hangman game has a small animation issue where the flag ends up at the wrong side of the screen after your third or second wrong try. It doesn't affect the gameplay at all. It may just look a bit strange from a player's perspective. I feel the strong need to mention that this was my very first "serious" coding project. I'm a complete beginner, a noob, an amateur you name it. But just like with every other skill, practice makes perfect ü´∂üèª

I only know for sure that the hangman game works on windows. Here is what is needed for it to work

1. VSCode
2. Python
3. the Python library 'Pygame' (type pip install pygame in the terminal in VSCode unless already installed, you need to have Python installed first)
4. the Python library 'TKinter' (type pip install tk in the terminal in VSCode unless already installed, you need to have Python installed first)

5. You need to extract the file to your desktop through the folder.
6. Look for the hangman game file inside the folder and click "extract all". The python file should be inside the folder called "HangmanGame.zip"
7. You need to run the Hangman game in VSCode. Don't forget to have Python and the libraries 'Pygame' and 'TKinter' installed.
